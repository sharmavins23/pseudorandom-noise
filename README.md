# Pseudorandom Noise

This project is a follow-along of
[Jasper Flick's Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/)
tutorial on
[pseudorandom noise](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/pseudorandom-noise).

Notably, this project was created via URP's default project, which (seemingly)
adds some form of global illumination and bloom. I think it looks fairly good,
so I'll keep it.

## Part 1 - [Hashing](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/pseudorandom-noise/hashing/)

This part entails creating a hashing function to create pseudorandom noise.
We'll visualize it on a grid of procedurally generated cubes. I'll draw these
with an image of 123 by 123 pixels.

| Grid                                      | Notes                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![img](img/hashing/base.png)              | Our base grid.                                                                                          |
| ![img](img/hashing/repeat256.png)         | Making our grid repeat every 256 values gives some interesting (non-random) effects.                    |
| ![img](img/hashing/weyl.png)              | Adding Weyl sequencing makes a repeating pattern where the direction is based on the resolution.        |
| ![img](img/hashing/uvWeyl.png)            | Basing the Weyl sequence on the UV coordinates of the points breaks the pattern up, but adds this grid. |
| ![img](img/hashing/xxhash32C.png)         | XXHash32 is a fast hashing function using 5 prime numbers. This is the output with only 1/5.            |
| ![img](img/hashing/xxhash32rotate.png)    | After 'eating' data, XXHash32 will 'rotate' bit values to further permute.                              |
| ![img](img/hashing/xxhash32CDE.png)       | Here is the hashed output after involving primes C, D, and E (3/5 primes).                              |
| ![img](img/hashing/xxhash32avalanche.png) | 'Avalanching' is the final step - XORing and shifting a lot of random bits repetitively.                |
| ![img](img/hashing/scaleInvariance.gif)   | This hashing function demonstrates scale invariance as well.                                            |
| ![img](img/hashing/hashColors.png)        | Our previous visualization only showed 1/4 of the random bytes. Now, we can see 3/4ths with colors.     |
| ![img](img/hashing/variedOffset.png)      | Finally, varying the offset lets us show the final random byte. Nice!                                   |

## Part 2 - [Hashing Space](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/pseudorandom-noise/hashing-space/)

Currently our hashing only works with two-dimensional non-transformed grids. We
can see this if we scale down our UV coordinates:

![img](img/hashing-space/uvquarter.png)

Applying a quarter-scale linear transformation causes the random values to
cluster, which is not usable. As such, let's fix this to be able to apply any
translation, rotation, and scaling. Like before, I'll summarize notes in a
table:

| Image                                     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/uvRotate.png)    | Adding support for transformation matrices allows us to rotate and scale our hashing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/zSlice.png)      | We can even rotate across axes to see different slices of the hash's volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/linearScale.png) | Moving this 3D object allows us to explore the global hash volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/rotation.png)    | This 3D support requires we make our displacement based off normal vectors instead of Y vectors.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/sphereMap.png)   | Since we have 3D support, we can map to all kinds of 3-dimensional objects. Here's a ball...                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/torus.png)       | Here's a torus with high resolution. An interesting band appears on top.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/star.png)        | I couldn't resist, and had to implement the spiral star from the graphs tutorial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/pulsingthin.gif) | With a tiny amount of work, we can make the objects pulse!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/octahedron.png)  | The UV sphere model bunches up at the poles. We can instead make an octagonal sphere out of an octagon.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/octasphere.png)  | This sphere has a much better distribution of points!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ![img](img/hashing-space/instance.gif)    | We can end off by increasing the size of each point in order to better demonstrate the surface. Here's a quick gif of higher scaling with the pulsating effect - The distance away from the 'surface mesh' is related to the random value in the most significant byte from our hashing function. Neat! |
