# Pseudorandom Noise

This project is a follow-along of
[Jasper Flick's Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/)
tutorial on
[pseudorandom noise](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/pseudorandom-noise).

## Part 1 - [Hashing](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/pseudorandom-noise/hashing/)

This part entails creating a hashing function to create pseudorandom noise.
We'll visualize it on a grid of procedurally generated cubes. I'll draw these
with an image of 123 by 123 pixels.

| Grid                         | Notes                                                                                  |
